## üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This project uses role-based access control to secure endpoints for different user types: `Recruiter`, `Freelancer`, and `Admin`.

### How to Protect Endpoints

1. **Import Decorator and Guard:**
   ```typescript
   import { Roles } from '../auth/decorators/role.decorator';
   import { RolesGuard } from '../auth/guards/role.guard';
   import { JwtAuthGuard } from '../auth/guards/jwt.strategy';
   import { UserRole } from '../auth/enums/userRole.enum';
   ```
2. **Apply to Controller Methods:**
   ```typescript
   @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
   @Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)
   @Get('admin-only')
   getAdminData() {
     // ...
   }
   ```
3. **Multiple Roles:**
   ```typescript
   @Roles(UserRole.RECRUITER, UserRole.ADMIN)
   ```

- The user's role is stored in the `role` field of the `User` entity.
- Unauthorized access is blocked automatically by the guard.

### Best Practices

- Always use `@Roles` and `RolesGuard` for sensitive or restricted endpoints.
- Add clear comments when a route is protected by RBAC.
- Review and update roles as new features and user types are added.
